This repository holds links to Q1 journals in biomedical computing, under the umbrella term 'AI for health'. 
These are publications at the intersection of Computing Science, Mathematics, Physics, Optics, Medicine and Biology. 
Typically they require novel contributions from all fields to succeed (and publish).

**Note**
These links are not auto-generated or validated, so ymmv, they do not confer a level of approval or validation. 
Usually they're on our radar after review or authoring of publications in them by researchers in the Hamarneh lab.

If you want to contribute, create a pull request.
